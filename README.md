# PotLuck

This repo holds the Firebase back end code to the PotLuck project. If you are wanting to get started building and running the app, please refer to the setup guide [here](https://github.com/mariecrane/PotLuck#flutter-and-project-setup).

## Firebase CLI and Project Setup

1. If you don't already have access to the Firebase console for the PotLuck project, you should request access from another team member.

2. Install the Firebase CLI for your operating system as instructed in this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli).

 - You should make sure the Node.js version installed on your machine via nvm is **v8.16.2**.

 - Make sure to follow the instructions to [Sign in and test the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

3. Clone this repo to a directory of your choice.
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/Preston12321/PotLuck-Firebase.git
    ```

## Deploying Changes

Extensive guides on [full](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deployment) and [partial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys) deployments already exist. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure this part out.
